# Game of Thrones Tweet Analysis — NLP Mini-Project

I explored tweets around key Game of Thrones episodes to see how topics and emotions spiked during big moments. I cleaned the text (lowercasing, stopwords, hashtags), built TF-IDF features, and used LSI (SVD) for simple topic modeling. I then tracked topic/hashtag activity over time to spot the peaks that line up with plot events.

**Where to look**
- **results/figures/** — my exported plots (top words, topic loadings, timelines).
- **data/sample/** — a tiny sample of the dataset for quick inspection/run-through.
- **in the docs** folder, you can find the complete html study and all the code used.
